### Question 1: Do I need to remove my useMemo and useCallback now?

No. It is safe to leave them in. Compiler does its own low-level memoization, and [understands and checks manual memoization](https://github.com/reactwg/react-compiler/discussions/16) for correctness.

### Question 2: Is there a difference between the memoization of useMemo, useCallback and React Compiler?

Yes. Compiler uses memoization techniques different from the memoizations of `useMemo` and `useCallback`. Specifically, the Compiler uses an internal React hook `_c` formerly called `useMemoCache`.

### Question 3: Does the Compiler need React 19?

No. The compiler does not ship with React 19 . You can use it with other React versions by installing react-compiler-runtime.

### Question 4: Are there ways to still manually optimize some files?

Yes. Use “use no memo“ in files you want the Compiler to skip.

### Question 5: How do I know if the code is compiled by the compiler?

1. If you are using React Devtools (v5.0+), you will notice a “Memo ✨” badge next to components that have been optimized by the compiler.

2. If you paste your code in the [React Compiler Playground](https://playground.react.dev/) , you will notice the functions get transformed by the `_c` hook, which denotes that compiler has optimized the code. Here’s an example of what that looks like -

```jsx
const $ = _c(9);
const { friends } = t0;
const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount();
if (friends.length === 0) {
  let t1;
  if ($[0] === Symbol.for('react.memo_cache_sentinel')) {
    t1 = <NoFriends />;
    $[0] = t1;
  } else {
    t1 = $[0];
  }
  return t1;
}
```
