React 19 introduces exciting new hooks—useFormStatus, useActionState, and useOptimistic. Let’s dive into what they bring to the table and how you can use them effectively.

1. **useFormStatus**:

Forms are complex, but this hook simplifies reading data about the form. It tracks form submission states through the pending flag which you can use it to add a pending state. This is also a handy hook because it provides the data object containing the submitted fields.

```jsx
const Loader = () => {
  const { pending, data } = useFormStatus();

  return <button disabled={pending}>Submit</button>;
};
```

**Important Note:**
useFormStatus must be used in a child component of the form. For example:

```jsx
function Loader() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return <div>{pending && 'Loading...'}</div>;
}

<form action={formAction}>
  <Loader />
</form>;
```

2. **useActionState**:

Need to manage state changes during form submissions? Use this hook! How this is different from the previous hook is because in addition to the pending flag, it gives back a `state` variable, which represents how `initialState` has changed after the `action` has executed.

```jsx
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(action, initialState);
```

It gives back the formAction which can be used to directly hook into a form in order to submit the form. Such as -

```jsx
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(action, initialState);
```

What makes this hook cool is that you can also use this to create a server action! Here’s a server action using useActionState.

```jsx
'use server';

export const submitFormAction = async (previousState, formData) => {
  const name = formData.get('inputName');

  await wait(500); // simulate calling an api

  return { ...previousState, name };
};
```

The only addition this action needed was a “use server” directive a the top, which makes it a server action.

2. **useActionState**:

Optimistic UI updates make your app feel faster by showing changes immediately, even before the server confirms them. How this is helpful is that assume a user writes an input such as their email address, and you need to validate this information on the server, you can optimistically show a checkmark ✅ , before waiting for the response from the server. It gives the impression of a performant UI. Another example is hitting a like button.

```jsx
const [optimisiticLikes, updateLikes] = useOptimistic(state, updateLikesFn);
```

Use this hook for actions like:

- Liking a post

- Validating form inputs

- Updating a shopping cart
