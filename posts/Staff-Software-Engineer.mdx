Navigating the journey from senior engineer to staff engineer can be daunting. Promotions are often confusing, and this particular leap can feel even more ambiguous. As someone who has successfully transitioned to a staff engineer role, I want to share my insights and experiences to help you on this journey.

In this blog, we’ll address key questions like:

- What is a Staff Engineer?
- How does it differ from a Senior Engineer?
- What do you need to become a Staff Engineer?
- How do you know you’re ready?
- Who do you talk to for guidance?

I’ll also share my personal story and a structured six-month plan to help you achieve your goals. Let’s dive in!

## My Path to Becoming a Staff Engineer

Over the last decade, I’ve worked at companies like PayPal and Slack, progressing from a junior web developer to a Staff Engineer. Here’s a quick timeline:

- Junior Web Developer at **Telus Communications** in 2013
- Web Developer at **Pix** in 2017
- Software Engineer 2 at **PayPal** in 2018
  - Promoted to Senior Software Engineer 3 in 2019 and later Staff Engineer in 2021.
- Lead Member of Technical Staff at **Slack** in 2022
  - Worked for three years before transitioning to **full-time content creation**.

One key lesson I’ve learned: **It’s not about what you do—it’s about who knows what you do.** Sharing your accomplishments is essential for recognition and promotion.

## What is a Staff Engineer?

A Staff Engineer is a **technical leader** who drives their team’s effectiveness. You’re judged not only by the features you deliver but also by how you enable and grow your team. Staff engineering is a blend of technical expertise, leadership, and mentorship.

### The Four Pillars of Staff Engineering:

1. **Technical Excellence**  
   Staff Engineers build scalable systems, evaluate technologies, and make critical technical decisions while managing technical debt.

2. **Organizational Impact**  
   They solve problems that extend beyond their team, acting as the communication link between various stakeholders.

3. **Mentorship and Team Development**  
   Staff Engineers grow their team by enabling others to succeed, onboarding new members, and leveling up their colleagues.

4. **Project Leadership**  
   They ensure projects are delivered on time, breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces while leading cross-functional initiatives.

## Story Time: Building Font Selection in Slack

As a Staff Engineer, I’ve had the privilege to work on some truly exciting projects. Not only have these opportunities helped me grow my technical expertise, but they’ve also taught me critical interpersonal skills—like team coordination, estimation, overcoming imposter syndrome, managing burnout, and effective delegation. These are essential qualities for any engineer looking to advance their career.

One standout project was the **Font Selection** feature in Slack. On the Appearance tab in Slack’s Preferences, users can now select a font—let’s say, Comic Sans—and instantly see the change reflected everywhere in the application.

This project was a classic example of a greenfield initiative; it had never been done before in Slack. That meant navigating technical debt, considering migrations to new systems, and sometimes deprecating outdated components. It also required collaboration with teams across the organization, because the blast radius of a feature like this was huge. The work impacted not just one area, but the entire user experience.

Being a technical leader on such a project was both challenging and rewarding. It stretched my skills and reinforced the importance of cross-functional teamwork and technical vision in delivering high-impact features.

## Why You Might Not Be Promoted Yet

Here are five common reasons holding people back:

1. **Waiting to Be Told You’re Ready**  
   Believe in yourself—don’t wait for external validation.

2. **Imposter Syndrome**  
   Everyone feels like an imposter at some point. Acknowledge it, but don’t let it hold you back.

3. **Waiting to Become a Deep Technical Expert**  
   You’ll learn on the job. If you’ve delivered impactful projects, you’re ready.

4. **Avoiding Politics**  
   Sharing your accomplishments isn’t “dirty politics”; it’s advocating for yourself based on facts.

5. **Struggling with Networking**  
   Everyone feels awkward at times. Start small: introduce yourself, share your goals, and seek connections.

## How to Become a Staff Engineer

Every company’s promotion process is different, but here are some general steps:

### 1. Evaluate Yourself

Create a requirements document using your company’s engineering ladder (or a publicly available template - [Block Engineering Career Ladder](https://assets.ctfassets.net/1wryd5vd9xez/3gb7ZSi95ipFegjuMWupGo/bcb0dd0253297bff48a4ad083b28d924/-Public-_Block_Engineering_Career_Ladder.pdf)). Assess each line item honestly—mark them as either "Achieving" or "Needs Work."

### 2. Discuss Gaps with Your Manager

Schedule a one-on-one to review your evaluation. Identify projects that can help you grow in areas where you need improvement.

### 3. Build a Support Squad

Find sponsors outside of your manager—mentors, mentees, or inspiring colleagues—who can vouch for your skills and impact.

### 4. Perform Like a Staff Engineer

Start acting as a Staff Engineer now. Deliver impactful projects, mentor others, and take ownership of technical decisions.

## How Does Staff Engineering Differ from Senior Engineering?

A Senior Engineer is typically assigned projects, while a Staff Engineer creates and owns projects. The scope of work for a Staff Engineer extends beyond individual contributions to influencing the broader organization and driving technical direction.

## ![Pre-requisite to become Staff Engineer](../images/staff-software-engineer/prerequisite.jpg)

## Building Your Portfolio

To transition to Staff Engineer, you’ll need:

- **At least three technical projects** demonstrating deep expertise, mentorship, organizational impact, and quality work.
- **Two mentees** (ideally from different teams) who you’ve guided on these projects.
- **Ownership of one product** where you’re the go-to expert.

---

## Gathering Proof

You need evidence to showcase your capabilities:

- **Write Technical Documentation**  
   Document every feature and project you work on. Invite feedback from your team and beyond.

- **Volunteer to Present**  
   Share your technical skills and represent your team.

- **Answer Questions in Feedback Channels**  
   Help others and document these interactions as proof of your contributions.

---

## The Promotion Process

Your manager submits a promotion packet to the committee. This packet includes:

1. **Brag Document**  
    A detailed log of your accomplishments, metrics (Lines of codes changed, PRs
   reviewed, PRs created, time it took to finish a feature) and growth.

2. **Career Plan**  
   A document showing your engineering ladder evaluation with proof for each line item. Aim for “Achieving” across the board.

   Refer to this career ladder template - [Block Engineering Career Ladder](https://assets.ctfassets.net/1wryd5vd9xez/3gb7ZSi95ipFegjuMWupGo/bcb0dd0253297bff48a4ad083b28d924/-Public-_Block_Engineering_Career_Ladder.pdf)

Both of these documents are not intended to keep private, instead your Manager should have a look at both of them.

## A Six-Month Plan to Get Promoted

Here’s a structured approach to help you navigate your promotion:

### Month 1: Evaluate Yourself

Review your company’s engineering ladder and assess your gaps. If they don't have one, use a publicly available career ladder.

### Month 2: Create a Plan

Discuss your evaluation with your manager. Identify projects to address your gaps.

### Month 3: Work on Impactful Projects

Start networking with your skip-level manager and other stakeholders.

### Month 4: Gather Proof

Document your work, seek feedback, and build evidence of your contributions.

### Month 5: Review Progress

Update your career doc and review it with your manager.

### Month 6+: Keep Going

The process may take longer than six months, but persistence and structure will help you get there.

## Final Thoughts

Promotion isn’t always about skills—it’s also about timing and organizational factors. If you’re feeling burnt out or unsure about continuing in tech, it’s okay to pause or reconsider your path.

Take charge of your career. Advocate for yourself and share your accomplishments. And if you need personalized guidance, book a one-on-one session with me to create a tailored career plan.
